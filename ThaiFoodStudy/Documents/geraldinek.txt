I have fond memories of the Thailand Cafe. This used to be my go-to
place for cheap dining when I was a student in the Boston area.  The
Thailand Cafe served as my introduction to Thai cuisine, but
ironically, nothing here is authentic. It's run by a Chinese couple
but the cheapness and portions are not to be dismissed.  I tried
almost all the seafood and vegetable entrees.  Here are my favorites
that I used to religiously rotate through on every visit:
-Pad thai with shrimp
-Seafood noodle (yellow egg noodle stir-fried with shrimp, squid,
scallops and vegetables)
-Pattaya Squid ( tender fresh squid sauteed with fresh carrot, sweet
basil, onion, mushroom & green peppers in a spicy sauce)
-Fisherman's Fury (stir-fried scallops, large shrimp, mussels & squid,
in our famous thai hot chili sauce with fresh mixed vegetable)
-Salmon Choo Chee (grilled salmon steak in famous thai choo chee curry
sauce with onion, tomato, green pepper, pineapple and sweet basil)

Honestly, the place is a hole-in-the wall, and it's located in sketchy
Central Square. But it never stopped me from ordering take out or
hauling my @ss over there when I had a craving for some Asian cookin'!
